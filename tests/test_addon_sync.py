"""Drift guards: assert addon-side and package-side mirrors stay in sync.

The Fusion add-in is installed into Fusion's AddIns folder and cannot
import from this package, so a few tables are duplicated:

* ``addon/server/hints.py:_RULES``   ↔  ``src/fusion360_mcp/hints.py:_RULES``
* ``CommandHandler._MUTATION_COMMANDS``  ↔  ``mock.py:_MUTATION_MOCKS``

If they drift, agents see different error envelopes / delta payloads
depending on whether they're running against Fusion or mock mode.  These
tests fail loudly the moment a maintainer updates one side without the
other.
