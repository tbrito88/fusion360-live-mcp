"""
Fusion360MCP Add-in (v2)

Registers a CustomEvent so all Fusion API calls run on the main thread.
A TCP socket server (daemon thread) accepts JSON commands and dispatches
them through an EventBridge.

Host/port override via env vars FUSION_MCP_HOST and FUSION_MCP_PORT.
Set FUSION_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 to expose the add-in on all interfaces
for cross-machine setups (MCP server on a different host). Only do
this on a trusted LAN — the socket has no authentication.
